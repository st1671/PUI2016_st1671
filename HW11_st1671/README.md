ASSIGNMENT 2

This assignment was kind of a tough assignment. First I met some probelm in downloading the zipfile, I meet a error  meassage said there
is 'Bad zipfile', it took me hours to figure this out while no one else met this error. And it turned out to be that it was just a broken 
zipfile.
And also it took me many time to reconstruct the data frame. 
Then I met a probelm in doing the Hierarchical Dendrogram, I got an error message said that 'Z used for more than one cluster', this problem
occured because there are 'inf' element in Z array.

I did this homeworkd by myself.
